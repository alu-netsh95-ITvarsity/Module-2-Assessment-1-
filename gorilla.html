                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical 
        forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: 
        the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies.
         The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included,
         and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
     <p>Gorillas are considered highly intelligent. A few individuals in captivity, such as Koko, 
         have been taught a subset of sign language.
          Like the other great apes, gorillas can laugh, grieve, have "rich emotional lives", 
          develop strong family bonds, make and use tools, and think about the past and future.
         Some researchers believe gorillas have spiritual feelings or religious sentiments.
         They have been shown to have cultures in different areas revolving around different methods of food 
         preparation, and will show individual colour preferences.</p>
   <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
       Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, 
       gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane 
       cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres 
       (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, 
       with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</p>
