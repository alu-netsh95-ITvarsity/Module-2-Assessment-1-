                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, 
        the other being the okapi. 
        The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.
        The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. 
        Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull 
        lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.
         One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 
         25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. 
         This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. 
         Giraffokeryx appeared 15 mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, 
         and had a longer neck and similar ossicones.
          Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and 
          Bramatherium.Giraffids like Palaeotragus, Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared 14 mya and lived
          throughout Africa and Eurasia. 
          These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls.
           Paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor.
           Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before Giraffokeryx.
           Samotherium was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage as its cervical 
           vertebrae was intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi, 
           and was more vertical than the okapi's.Bohlinia, which first appeared in southeastern Europe 
           and lived 9–7 mya was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. 
           Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and
            dentition.</p>
     <p> Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.
         The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.
          Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.The skin of a giraffe is 
          mostly gray,[46] or tan, and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).
         The 80–100 centimetres (31–39 in) long[41] tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense 
         against insects.</p>
   <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer Acacieae, 
       Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands.</p>

    <p>You will them near the bears and koala.</p>
